1. NM LOCK COUNT INCREADED FROM 5 TO 180
2. DEFAULT CALIBRATION CHANGED .
3. NM LOCK WILL RESET WHEN PUSH BUTTON IS PRESSED.
4. NM EXIT TIME DUE TO FALSE CURRENT CHANGED TO 3 MINUTES FROM 50 MINUTES.
853
5. REMOVED VER# FROM DISPLAY
6. NOW IT CAN BE READ FROM COMMUNICATION. COMMAND "EEOVER0D0A";


862
1. earth is blinking. which is not correct.
2. dc immunity range new set.

866
1. change in nm logic in normal mode.

868
1. Change in production display parameters.
2. removed blinking in production mode.
3. now command added to change offset values for current.
4. show rev icon in production mode.
 
875
1. dynamic offset added when current flows through CT.
2. change nm case if voltage is less than 120V
0.03.14
1. erase blocked in user mode.
0.03.15
1. first billing happening in NM if there is not LS data logged in normal mode.
0.03.16
1. power on duration is coorected in case meter RUN in NM.

0.03.17
1. billing occurs while erased in NM case.
0.03.17
inavlid

0.03.019
1. ND detection logic changed in case if it is applied REV.
2. i2c reset clock increased for i2c hang problem.

1.04.017
 1. dc magnet immune logic changed.
1.04.023
1. meter will not run below 100V
2. meter will comes only from power off mode if volatge is greater than 110V or if less than 110V and load is earthed.
1.04.024
1. meter takes time from battery mode to normal mode if supply is applied on portable source, if battery mode time is more than 5 mins.
2. VRTC pin will get supply from MCU in AC supply condition.
3. Now all seg will show when memtest command will be received in production mode.
4. first stage powerfail data will be saved when voltage is less than 120V.
4.65.000
prekWh initial value changed.
1. some times crc of data saved at power fail event mismatched. this is beacuse 12 bit timer counter modify pulse counter values after calculatiing crc.
2. if there is no more than .1 kwh increament in one run, and kwh increased more than 3 kwh in such repeatition then kwh will become 0. now it is corrected.
3. power fail data saved 1 level voltage chnaged to 120V. 

900
1. magnet logic changed.
2. power assigned before tamper checking.

904
.1. NM accuracy flactuating.

21
1. magnet time will be 5 mins.

10/07/2023-025
1. nm volatge is now 70V , earlier was 90V
2. default tod zones will be 4 as per given by prashant.
10/07/2023-026
1. there is no default energy calculation.
11/07/2023-027
1. now nd will also detect above 145% of Vref.
